# Calc-II-Numerical-Methods
An interactive Jupyter notebook that explains the order of a numerical method. This notebook covers Left Riemann sums, Right Riemann sums, Midpoint Rule, Trapezoid Rule, and Simpson's rule. This notebook also covers how to use log-log plots as the mathematically rigorous way of investigating the order of a numerical method.

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

Note: the mybinder.org servers are not always running. If you're having difficulty launching the notebook please check the status of the servers at http://mybinder.org/status

If you download the files to your computer make sure that you have the areaTools.py file: these are the backend functions that create the simulations in the notebook.

# Calc-II-Numerical-Methods
An interactive Jupyter notebook that explains the order of a numerical method. This notebook covers Left Riemann sums, Right Riemann sums, Midpoint Rule, Trapezoid Rule, and Simpson's rule. This notebook also covers how to use log-log plots as the mathematically rigorous way of investigating the order of a numerical method.

You can either download the files and run the Notebook on your local machine or you can launch the Notebook by clicking on the mybinder.org link below.

If you download the files to your computer make sure that you have the areaTools.py file: these are the backend functions that create the simulations in the notebook.
